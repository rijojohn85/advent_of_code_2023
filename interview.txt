Hi,
I am Rijo John. I was born and bought up in Bangalore.
I did my schooling in St. Joseph's Boy's High School.
After graduating in 2009, I did my Bacherlors of Engineering
in Industrial Engineering from BMS College of Engineering.
I got placed in Mu Sigma Business Solutions, a data analytics company,
at Campus placements. I joined Mu Sigma in July 2013 as a trainee 
decision scientist. I worked with the marketing team of a leading
Ecommerce company in the united states. I realised I was not enjoying
my role here. I wanted to work in a core industry, but when I graduated,
almost none came for recruitment. I started looking out for opportunities
outside and I was able to get a job as a production engineer with 
New Swan Multitech. They are an automotive parts manufacturer. 
There I was responsible for daily production planning. I also had to 
ensure availability of raw materials. I had to liason with upper
management and employees for better smooth production flow. 
For me, career growth is important. In 2018, I left the job to pursue
my MBA from the University of Melbourne. I returned in late 2019 
and started looking for job. I joined Ductrove Pvt Ltd,
a manufacturer of ducts for OFC cables, as an 
Assistant Production Manager where i led the production Engineering
processes. I planned maintaince schedules to minimize downtime.
I helped establish safety procedures and environmental
regulations for employees. I realised the scope for growth within
the company was low and decided it was time to leave. I have
always been interested in the aerospace industry. I was talking
a friend of my father's, Mr. Mattukutty Sebastian. He suggested
that I reach out to Mr Babu. So here I am.
